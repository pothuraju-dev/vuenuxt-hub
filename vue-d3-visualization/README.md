# 📊 VueNuxt Hub – D3 Chart Showcase

A collection of reusable Vue 3 chart components built with D3.js – designed to help developers learn and implement real-world chart visualizations with clean, working examples.

## 🎯 Purpose

While exploring D3 chart tutorials online, many examples were incomplete or didn't fully work inside Vue apps. This project fixes that by offering:

- 💡 Working chart components for Vue 3 + D3
- 🧩 Real-world use cases with sample data
- 📝 Each chart has its own page with explanations
- ✅ Code that’s readable, customizable, and ready to reuse
